.TH "IOCONTROL - IOV2" "1"  "2021-04" "LinuxCNC Documentation" "The Enhanced Machine Controller"
.SH NAME
iov2 \- interacts with HAL or G-code in userspace
.SH SYNOPSIS

.B [EMCIO]
.br
.B EMCIO = iov2

.SH DESCRIPTION

I/O control handles I/O tasks like coolant, toolchange, e-stop and lube. The signals are turned on and off in userspace with G-code or in the case of e-stop in hal. 
.br
I/O Control V2 (iov2) adds more toolchager support for communication with the toolchanger.

Whether \fBio\fR or \fBiov2\fR is used can be chosen in the [EMCIO] section of the INI file.

.SH Pins
.SS Basic pins

.TP
\fBiocontrol.0.coolant\-flood
(Bit, Out) TRUE when flood coolant is requested


.TP
\fBiocontrol.0.coolant\-mist 
(Bit, Out) TRUE when mist coolant is requested

.TP
\fBiocontrol.0.emc\-enable\-in 
(Bit, In) Should be driven FALSE when an external estop condition exists.

.TP
\fBiocontrol.0.lube 
(Bit, Out) TRUE when lube is requested.  This pin gets driven True when
the controller comes out of E-stop, and when the "Lube On" command gets
sent to the controller.  It gets driven False when the controller goes
into E-stop, and when the "Lube Off" command gets sent to the controller.

.TP
\fBiocontrol.0.lube_level 
(Bit, In) Should be driven FALSE when lubrication tank is empty.

.TP
\fBiocontrol.0.tool\-change 
(Bit, Out) TRUE when a tool change is requested

.TP
\fBiocontrol.0.tool\-changed 
(Bit, In) Should be driven TRUE when a tool change is completed.

.TP
\fBiocontrol.0.tool\-number
(s32, Out) Current tool number

.TP
\fBiocontrol.0.tool\-prep\-number 
(s32, Out) The number of the next tool, from the RS274NGC T-word

.TP
\fBiocontrol.0.tool\-prep\-pocket
(s32, Out) This is the pocket number (location in the tool storage
mechanism) of the tool requested by the most recent T-word.

.TP
\fBiocontrol.0.tool\-prepare 
(Bit, Out) TRUE when a T\fIn\fR tool prepare is requested

.TP
\fBiocontrol.0.tool\-prepared 
(Bit, In) Should be driven TRUE when a tool prepare is completed.

.TP
\fBiocontrol.0.user\-enable\-out 
(Bit, Out) FALSE when an internal estop condition exists

.TP
\fBiocontrol.0.user\-request\-enable 
(Bit, Out) TRUE when the user has requested that estop be cleared


.SS Additional IO v2 pins
.TP
\fBiocontrol.0.emc\-abort
(BIT,OUT) Signals emc\-originated abort to toolchanger.
.TP
\fBiocontrol.0.emc\-abort\-ack
(BIT,IN) Acknowledge line from toolchanger for previous signal, or jumpered to abort\-tool\-change if not used in toolchanger. NB: after signaling an emc\-abort, iov2 will block until emc\-abort\-ack is raised. 
.TP
\fBiocontrol.0.emc\-reason
(S32,OUT) Convey cause for EMC\-originated abort to toolchanger. Usage: UI informational. Valid during emc\-abort True. 
.TP
\fBiocontrol.0.start\-change
(BIT,OUT) Asserted at the very beginning of an M6 operation, before any spindle\-off, quill\-up, or move\-to\-toolchange\-position oeprations are executed.
.TP
\fBiocontrol.0.start\-change\-ack
(BIT,IN) Acknowledgment line for start\-change.
.TP
\fBiocontrol.0.toolchanger\-fault
(BIT,IN) Toolchanger signals fault. This line is contionuously monitored. A fault toogles a flag in iocontrol which is reflected in the toolchanger\-faulted pin.
.TP
\fBiocontrol.0.toolchanger\-fault\-ack
(BIT,OUT) Handshake line for above signal. will be set by iov2 after above fault line True is recognized and deasserted when toolchanger\-fault drops. Toolchanger is free to interpret the ack; reading the \-ack lines assures fault has been received and acted upon.
.TP
\fBiocontrol.0.toolchanger\-reason
(S32,IN) Convey reason code for toolchanger\-originated fault to iov2. Usage
.TP
\fBiocontrol.0.toolchanger\-faulted
(BIT,OUT) Signals toolchanger\-notify line has toggled and toolchanger\-reason\-code was in the fault range. Next M6 will abort.
.TP
\fBiocontrol.0.toolchanger\-clear\-fault
(BIT,IN) Resets TC fault condition. Deasserts toolchanger\-faulted if toolchanger\-notify is line False. Usage. UI \- e.g. clear fault condition button. 
.TP
\fBiocontrol.0.state
(S32,OUT) Debugging pin reflecting internal state
