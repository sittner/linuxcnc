millturn usage:

For additional information see the README in the millturn folder.

1) startup (after homing) the simulation is in mill mode as configured in millturn.ini (mm-based) with 3 cartesian linear joints (XYZ) and 1 rotary joint (A).

2) pyvcp buttons are provided to switch between mill and turn kinematics. The buttons issue remapped commands M428,M429.

These commands
a) set the motion.switchkins-type pin and
b) force a synchronization using a motion input read command.
c) set softlimits according to values set in millturn.ini [AXIS_X] and [AXIS_Z] section.

3) when set for mill, default assignments are:

   x : joint0
   y : joint1
   z : joint2
   a : joint3

so the gcode commands:
   'g0x10' moves joint0
   'g0z10' moves joint2

4) when set for turn, assignments are:

   x :  joint2
   y : -joint1
   z :  joint0
   a :  joint3

so the gcode commands:
   'g0x10' moves joint2
   'g0z10' moves joint0
